### About
I obtained my medical degree from Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and currently I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Orthopedic Transdisciplinary Applied Research (COTAR). My primary research interests lie in the field of regenerative medicine, with a particular emphasis on orthopedic applications. Additionally, I have a keen interest in design thinking and artificial intelligence, exploring their potential integration and implementation within the medical domain. I am enthusiastic about interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge innovative technologies with clinical practice to advance patient care and outcomes.  
I'll share my progress in programming and my useful drafts here.
